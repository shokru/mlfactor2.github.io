    "Conclusions often echo introductions. This chapter was completed at the very end of the writing of the book. It outlines principles and ideas that are probably more relevant than the sum of technical details covered subsequently. When stuck with disappointing results, we advise the reader to take a step away from the algorithm and come back to this section to get a broader perspective of some of the issues in predictive modelling."

    "First, the **data**. Nowadays, classical providers, such as Bloomberg and Reuters have seen their playing field invaded by niche players and aggregation platforms. In addition, high-frequency data and derivative quotes have become mainstream. Hence, firm-specific attributes are easy and often cheap to compile. This means that the size of $\\mathbf{X}$ in (2.1) is now sufficiently large to be plugged into ML algorithms. The order of magnitude (in 2025, it has not changed much from 2019 in fact) that can be reached is the following:  \n",

    "- a few hundred monthly observations (a few decades)        \n",
    "- over several thousand stocks (US listed at least)    \n",
    "- covering a few hundred attributes (sometimes a few thousand, with possible colinearity). \n",

    "This makes a dataset of dozens of millions of points. While it is a reasonably high figure, we highlight that the chronological depth is probably the weak point and will remain so for decades to come because accounting figures are only released on a quarterly basis. This can somewhat be alleviated when generating synthetic data, though the efficiency of such strategy remains to be demonstrated. Needless to say that this drawback does not hold for high-frequency strategies that rely on intraday data (out of the scope of the present monograph)."

    "Second, **computational power**, both through hardware and software. Storage and processing speed are not technical hurdles anymore and models can even be run on the cloud thanks to services hosted by major actors (Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google) and by smaller players (Rackspace, Techila). On the software side, open source has become the norm, funded by corporations (TensorFlow & Keras by Google, Pytorch by META/Facebook, h2o, etc.), universities (Scikit-Learn by INRIA, NLPCore by Stanford, NLTK by UPenn) and small groups of researchers (caret, xgboost, catboost, lightGBM, tidymodels to list but a pair of frameworks). Consequently, ML is no longer the private turf of a handful of expert computer scientists, but is on the contrary **accessible** to anyone willing to learn and code. Moreover, with the advent of Large Languages Models, coding has never been easier. "

    "Finally, **economic framing**. Machine learning applications in finance were initially introduced by computer scientists and information system experts (e.g., {cite:p}`braun1987predicting`, {cite:p}`white1988economic`) and exploited shortly after by academics in financial economics ({cite:p}`bansal1993no`), and hedge funds (see, e.g., {cite:p}`zuckerman2019man`). Nonlinear relationships then became more mainstream in asset pricing ({cite:p}`freeman1992nonlinear`, {cite:p}`bansal1993new`). These contributions started to pave the way for the more brute-force approaches that have blossomed since the 2010 decade and which are mentioned throughout the book."

    "In the synthetic proposal of {cite:p}`arnott2019backtesting`, the first piece of advice is to rely on a model that makes sense economically. We agree with this stance, and the only assumption that we make in this book is that future returns depend on firm characteristics. The relationship between these features and performance is largely unknown and probably time-varying. This is why ML can be useful: to detect some hidden patterns beyond the documented asset pricing anomalies. Moreover, dynamic training allows to adapt to changing market conditions."

To the best of our knowledge, the only consensus is that, on the $\\textbf{x}$ side, the features should include classical predictors reported in the literature: market capitalization, accounting ratios, risk measures, momentum proxies (see Chapter 3). For the dependent variable, many researchers and practitioners work with monthly returns, but other maturities may perform better out-of-sample."

    "By definition, the curse of predictions is that they rely on **past** data to infer patterns about **subsequent** fluctuations. The more or less explicit hope of any forecaster is that the past will turn out to be a good approximation of the future. Needless to say, this is a pious wish; in general, predictions fare badly. Surprisingly, this does not depend much on the sophistication of the econometric tool. In fact, heuristic guesses are often hard to beat."
