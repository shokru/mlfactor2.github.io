Rather, it is intended to give a broad overview and cover the essential themes so that the reader is guided towards the relevant references. As such, it can serve as a short, non-exhaustive, review of the literature. The subject of factor modelling in finance is incredibly vast and the number of papers dedicated to it is substantial and still rapidly increasing."

    "The universe of peer-reviewed financial journals can be split in two. The first kind is the **academic journals**. Their articles are mostly written by professors, and the audience consists mostly of scholars. The articles are long and often technical. Prominent examples are the *Journal of Finance*, the *Review of Financial Studies* and the *Journal of Financial Economics*. The second type is more **practitioner**-orientated. The papers are shorter, easier to read, and target finance professionals predominantly. Two emblematic examples are the *Journal of Portfolio Management* and the *Financial Analysts Journal*. This chapter reviews and mentions articles published essentially in the first family of journals."

    "The topic of factor investing, though a decades-old academic theme, has gained traction concurrently with the rise of equity traded funds (ETFs) as vectors of investment. Both have gathered momentum in the 2010 decade. Not so surprisingly, the feedback loop between practical financial engineering and academic research has stimulated both sides in a mutually beneficial manner. Practitioners rely on key scholarly findings (e.g., asset pricing anomalies) while researchers dig deeper into pragmatic topics (e.g., factor exposure or transaction costs). Recently, researchers have also tried to quantify and qualify the impact of factor indices on financial markets. For instance, {cite:p}`krkoska2019herding` analyze herding behaviors while {cite:p}`cong2019rise` show that the introduction of composite securities increases volatility and cross-asset correlations.\n"

    "The core aim of factor models is to understand the **drivers of asset prices**. Broadly speaking, the rationale behind factor investing is that the financial performance of firms depends on factors, whether they be latent and unobservable, or related to intrinsic characteristics (like accounting ratios for instance). Indeed, as {cite:p}`cochrane2011presidential` frames it, the first essential question is *which characteristics really provide independent information about average returns?* Answering this question helps understand the cross-section of returns and may open the door to their prediction.\n"

Indeed, according to the CAPM, the only driver of returns is the market portfolio. This explains why factors are also called ‘anomalies’.\n"

    "Empirical evidence of asset pricing anomalies has accumulated since the dual publication of {cite:p}`fama1992cross` and {cite:p}`fama1993common`. This seminal work has paved the way for a blossoming stream of literature that has its meta-studies (e.g., {cite:p}`green2013supraview`, {cite:p}`harvey2016and` and {cite:p}`mclean2016does`). The regression (3.1) can be evaluated once (unconditionally) or sequentially over different time frames. In the latter case, the parameters (coefficient estimates) change and the models are thus called conditional (we refer to {cite:p}`ang2012testing` and to {cite:p}`cooper2018new` for recent results on this topic as well as for a detailed review on the related research). Conditional models are more flexible because they acknowledge that the drivers of asset prices may not be constant, which seems like a reasonable postulate.\n"

    "Obviously, a crucial step is to be able to identify an anomaly and the complexity of this task should not be underestimated. Given the publication bias towards positive results (see, e.g., {cite:p}`harvey2017presidential` in financial economics), researchers are often tempted to report partial results that are sometimes invalidated by further studies. The need for replication is therefore high and many findings have no tomorrow ({cite:p}`linnainmaa2018history`, {cite:p}`johannesson2020explanatory`), especially if transaction costs are taken into account ({cite:p}`patton2020you`, {cite:p}`chen2020zeroing`). Nevertheless, as is demonstrated by {cite:p}`chen2020limits`, $p$-hacking alone cannot account for all the anomalies documented in the literature. One way to reduce the risk of spurious detection is to increase the hurdles (often, the $t$-statistics) but the debate is still ongoing ({cite:p}`harvey2016and`, {cite:p}`chen2020t`), or to resort to multiple testing ({cite:p}`harvey2019evaluation`, {cite:p}`vincent2020investment`).\n"

    "Some researchers document fading anomalies because of publication: once the anomaly becomes public, agents invest in it, which pushes prices up and the anomaly disappears. {cite:p}`mclean2016does` document this effect in the US but {cite:p}`jacobs2019anomalies` find that all other countries experience sustained post-publication factor returns. With a different methodology, {cite:p}`chen2020publication` introduce a publication bias adjustment for returns and the authors note that this (negative) adjustment is in fact rather small. {cite:p}`penasse2018understanding` recommends the notion of *alpha decay* to study the persistence or attenuation of anomalies.\n"

    "The destruction of factor premia may be due to herding ({cite:p}`krkoska2019herding`, {cite:p}`volpati2020zooming`) and could be accelerated by the democratization of so-called smart-beta products (ETFs notably) that allow investors to directly invest in particular styles (value, low volatility, etc.). For a theoretical perspective on the attractivity of factor investing, we refer to {cite:p}`jin2019drivers`. On the other hand, {cite:p}`demiguel2019crowding` argue that the price impact of crowding in the smart-beta universe is mitigated by trading diversification stemming from external institutions that trade according to strategies outside this space (e.g., high frequency traders betting via order-book algorithms).\n"

    "The outcome is a time series of portfolio returns $r_t^j$ for each grouping $j$. An anomaly is identified if the $t$-test between the first ($j=1$) and the last group ($j=J$) unveils a significant difference in average returns. More robust tests are described in {cite:p}`cattaneo2019characteristic`. A strong limitation of this approach is that the sorting criterion could have a non-monotonic impact on returns and a test based on the two extreme portfolios would not detect it. Several articles address this concern: {cite:p}`patton2010monotonicity` and {cite:p}`romano2013testing` for instance. Another concern is that these sorted portfolios may capture not only the priced risk associated with the characteristic but also some unpriced risk. {cite:p}`daniel2020cross` show that it is possible to disentangle the two and make the most of altered sorted portfolios.\n"

    "Instead of focusing on only one criterion, it is possible to group assets according to more characteristics. The original paper {cite:p}`fama1992cross` also combines market capitalization with book-to-market ratios. Each characteristic is divided into 10 buckets, which makes 100 portfolios in total. Beyond data availability, there is no upper bound on the number of features that can be included in the sorting process. In fact, some authors investigate more complex sorting algorithms that can manage a potentially large number of characteristics (see e.g., {cite:p}`feng2019taming` and {cite:p}`bryzgalova2019bayesian`).\n"

    "The construction of so-called factors follows the same lines as above. Portfolios are based on one characteristic and the factor is a long-short ensemble of one extreme portfolio minus the opposite extreme (small minus large for the size factor or high book-to-market ratio minus low book-to-market ratio for the value factor). Sometimes, subtleties include forming bivariate sorts and aggregating several portfolios together, as in the original contribution of Fama and French (1993). The most common factors are listed below, along with a few references. We refer to the books listed at the beginning of the chapter for a more exhaustive treatment of factor idiosyncrasies. For most anomalies, theoretical justifications have been brought forward, whether risk-based or behavioral. We list the most frequently cited factors below:"

    "- Momentum (**WML** = winners minus losers): Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), Carhart (1997) and C. S. Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013). The winners are the assets that have experienced the highest returns over the last year (sometimes the computation of the return is truncated to omit the last month). Cross-sectional momentum is linked, but not equivalent, to time series momentum (trend following), see e.g., Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen (2012) and Lempérière et al. (2014). Momentum is also related to contrarian movements that occur both at higher and lower frequencies (short-term and long-term reversals), see Luo, Subrahmanyam, and Titman (2020).\n",
    "- Profitability (**RMW** = robust minus weak profits): Fama and French (2015), Bouchaud et al. (2019). In the former reference, profitability is measured as (revenues - (cost and expenses))/equity.\n",
    "- Investment (**CMA** = conservative minus aggressive): Fama and French (2015), Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). Investment is measured via the growth of total assets (divided by total assets). Aggressive firms are those that experience the largest growth in assets.\n",
    "- Low `risk’ (sometimes, **BAB** = betting against beta): Ang et al. (2006), Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler (2011), Frazzini and Pedersen (2014), Boloorforoosh et al. (2020), Baker, Hoeyer, and Wurgler (2020) and Asness et al. (2020). In this case, the computation of risk changes from one article to the other (simple volatility, market beta, idiosyncratic volatility, etc.)."

    "While these factors (i.e., long-short portfolios) exhibit time-varying risk premia and are magnified by corporate news and announcements (Engelberg, McLean, and Pontiff (2018)), it is well-documented (and accepted) that they deliver positive returns over long horizons. We refer to Gagliardini, Ossola, and Scaillet (2016) and to the survey Gagliardini, Ossola, and Scaillet (2019), as well as to the related bibliography for technical details on estimation procedures of risk premia and the corresponding empirical results. A large sample study that documents regime changes in factor premia was also carried out by Ilmanen et al. (2019). Moreover, the predictability of returns is also time-varying (as documented in Farmer, Schmidt, and Timmermann (2019), Tsiakas, Li, and Zhang (2020) and Liu, Pan, and Wang (2020)), and estimation methods can be improved (Johnson (2019))."

    "The individual attributes of investors who allocate towards particular factors is a blossoming topic. We list a few references below, even though they somewhat lie out of the scope of this book. Betermier, Calvet, and Sodini (2017) show that value investors are older, wealthier and face lower income risk compared to growth investors who are those in the best position to take financial risks. The study Cronqvist, Siegel, and Yu (2015) leads to different conclusions: it finds that the propensity to invest in value versus growth assets has roots in genetics and in life events (the latter effect being confirmed in Cocco, Gomes, and Lopes (2020), and the former being further detailed in a more general context in Cronqvist et al. (2015)). Psychological traits can also explain some factors: when agents extrapolate, they are likely to fuel momentum (this topic is thoroughly reviewed in Barberis (2018)). Micro- and macro-economic consequences of these preferences are detailed in Bhamra and Uppal (2019). To conclude this paragraph, we mention that theoretical models have also been proposed that link agents’ preferences and beliefs (via prospect theory) to market anomalies (see for instance Barberis, Jin, and Wang (2020))."

    "Finally, we highlight the need of replicability of factor premia and echo the recent editorial by Harvey (2020). As is shown by Linnainmaa and Roberts (2018) and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2020), many proclaimed factors are in fact very much data-dependent and often fail to deliver sustained profitability when the investment universe is altered or when the definition of variable changes (Clifford Asness and Frazzini (2013))."

    "Campbell Harvey and his co-authors, in a series of papers, tried to synthesize the research on factors in Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016), C. Harvey and Liu (2019) and Harvey and Liu (2019). His work underlines the need to set high bars for an anomaly to be called a ‘true’ factor. Increasing thresholds for $p$-values is only a partial answer, as it is always possible to resort to data snooping in order to find an optimized strategy that will fail out-of-sample but that will deliver a $t$-statistic larger than three (or even four). Harvey (2017) recommends to resort to a Bayesian approach which blends data-based significance with a prior into a so-called Bayesianized *p*-value (see subsection below)."

    "Following this work, researchers have continued to explore the richness of this zoo. Bryzgalova, Huang, and Julliard (2019) propose a tractable Bayesian estimation of large-dimensional factor models and evaluate all possible combinations of more than 50 factors, yielding an incredibly large number of coefficients. This combined with a Bayesianized Fama and MacBeth (1973) procedure allows to distinguish between pervasive and superfluous factors. Chordia, Goyal, and Saretto (2020) use simulations of 2 million trading strategies to estimate the rate of *false discoveries*, that is, when a spurious factor is detected (type I error). They also advise to use thresholds for t-statistics that are well above three. In a similar vein, Harvey and Liu (2020) also underline that sometimes *true* anomalies may be missed because of a one time $t$-statistic that is too low (type II error)."

    "The propensity of journals to publish positive results has led researchers to estimate the difference between reported returns and *true* returns. A. Y. Chen and Zimmermann (2020) call this difference the *publication bias* and estimate it as roughly 12%. That is, if a published average return is 8%, the actual value may in fact be closer to (1-12%)*8%=7%. Qualitatively, this estimation of 12% is smaller than the out-of-sample reduction in returns found in McLean and Pontiff (2016)."

    "where the vector $\\textbf{r}$ stacks all returns of all stocks and $\\textbf{x}$ is a lagged variable so that the regression is indeed predictive. If the estimated $\\hat{b}$ is significant given a specified threshold, then it can be tempting to conclude that $\\textbf{x}$ does a good job at predicting returns. Hence, long-short portfolios related to extreme values of $\\textbf{x}$ (mind the sign of $\\hat{b}$) are expected to generate profits. This is unfortunately often false because $\\hat{b}$ gives information on the past* ability of $\\textbf{x}$ to forecast returns. What happens in the future may be another story."

    "Statistical tests are also used for portfolio sorts. Assume two extreme portfolios are expected to yield very different average returns (like very small cap versus very large cap, or strong winners versus bad losers). The portfolio returns are written $r_t^+$ and $r_t^-$. The simplest test for the mean is $t=\\sqrt{T}\\frac{m_{r_+}-m_{r_-}}{\\sigma_{r_+-r_-}}$, where $T$ is the number of points and $m_{r_\\pm}$ denotes the means of returns and $\\sigma_{r_+-r_-}$ is the standard deviation of the difference between the two series, i.e., the volatility of the long-short portfolio. In short, the statistic can be viewed as a scaled Sharpe ratio (though usually these ratios are computed for long-only portfolios) and can in turn be used to compute $p$-values to assess the robustness of an anomaly. As is shown in Linnainmaa and Roberts (2018) and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2020), many factors discovered by reasearchers fail to survive in out-of-sample tests."

    "One reason why people are overly optimistic about anomalies they detect is the widespread reverse interpretation of the p-value. Often, it is thought of as the probability of one hypothesis (e.g., my anomaly exists) given the data. In fact, it’s the opposite; it’s the likelihood of your data sample, knowing that the anomaly holds."

    "where $t$ is the $t$-statistic obtained from the regression (i.e., the one that defines the p-value) and prior is the analyst’s estimation of the odds that the hypothesis (anomaly) is true. The prior is coded as follows. Suppose there is a p% chance that the null holds (i.e., (1-p)% for the anomaly). The odds are coded as $p/(1-p)$. Thus, if the t-statistic is equal to 2 (corresponding to a p-value of 5% roughly) and the prior odds are equal to 6, then the Bpv is equal to $e^{-2}\\times 6 \\times(1+e^{-2}\\times 6)^{-1}\\approx 0.448$ and there is a 44.8% chance that the null is true. This interpretation stands in sharp contrast with the original $p$-value which cannot be viewed as a probability that the null holds. Of course, one drawback is that the level of the prior is crucial and solely user-specified."

    "The work of Chinco, Neuhierl, and Weber (2020) is very different but shares some key concepts, like the introduction of Bayesian priors in regression outputs. They show that coercing the predictive regression with an $L^2$ constraint (see the ridge regression in Chapter 5) amounts to introducing views on what the true distribution of $b$ is. The stronger the constraint, the more the estimate $\\hat{b}$ will be shrunk towards zero. One key idea in their work is the assumption of a distribution for the true $b$ across many anomalies. It is assumed to be Gaussian and centered. The interesting parameter is the standard deviation: the larger it is, the more frequently significant anomalies are discovered. Notably, the authors show that this parameter changes through time and we refer to the original paper for more details on this subject."

Indeed, redundancies imply collinearity which is known to perturb estimates (Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (2005)). In addition, when asset managers decompose the performance of their returns into factors, overlaps (high absolute correlations) between factors yield exposures that are less interpretable; positive and negative exposures compensate each other spuriously."

    "At a more macro-level, researchers also try to figure out which models (i.e., combinations of factors) are the most likely, given the data empirically observed (and possibly given priors formulated by the econometrician). For instance, this stream of literature seeks to quantify to which extent the 3-factor model of Fama and French (1993) outperforms the 5 factors in Fama and French (2015). In this direction, De Moor, Dhaene, and Sercu (2015) introduce a novel computation for p-values that compare the relative likelihood that two models pass a zero-alpha test. More generally, the Bayesian method of Barillas and Shanken (2018) was subsequently improved by Chib, Zeng, and Zhao (2020)."

    "The decomposition of returns into linear factor models is convenient because of its simple interpretation. There is nonetheless a debate in the academic literature about whether firm returns are indeed explained by exposure to macro-economic factors or simply by the characteristics of firms. In their early study, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994) argue that one explanation of the value premium comes from incorrect extrapolation of past earning growth rates. Investors are overly optimistic about firms subject to recent profitability. Consequently, future returns are (also) driven by the core (accounting) features of the firm. The question is then to disentangle which effect is the most pronounced when explaining returns: characteristics versus exposures to macro-economic factors."

    "In their seminal contribution on this topic, Daniel and Titman (1997) provide evidence in favour of the former (two follow-up papers are K. Daniel, Titman, and Wei (2001) and Daniel and Titman (2012)). They show that firms with high book-to-market ratios or small capitalizations display higher average returns, even if they are negatively loaded on the HML or SMB factors. Therefore, it seems that it is indeed the intrinsic characteristics that matter, and not the factor exposure. For further material on characteristics’ role in return explanation or prediction, we refer to the following contributions: - Section 2.5.2. in Goyal (2012) surveys pre-2010 results on this topic;\n",
    "- Chordia, Goyal, and Shanken (2019) find that characteristics explain a larger proportion of variation in estimated expected returns than factor loadings;\n",

    "- Han et al. (2019) show with penalized regressions that 20 to 30 characteristics (out of 94) are useful for the prediction of monthly returns of US stocks. Their methodology is interesting: they regress returns against characteristics to build forecasts and then regress the returns on the forecast to assess if they are reliable. The latter regression uses a LASSO-type penalization (see Chapter 5) so that useless characteristics are excluded from the model. The penalization is extended to elasticnet in Rapach and Zhou (2019).\n",
    "- Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (2019) and Kim, Korajczyk, and Neuhierl (2019) both estimate models in which factors are latent but loadings (betas) and possibly alphas depend on characteristics. Kirby (2020) generalizes the first approach by introducing regime-switching. In contrast, Lettau and Pelger (2020a) and Lettau and Pelger (2020b) estimate latent factors without any link to particular characteristics (and provide large sample asymptotic properties of their methods).\n",

The authors show that in some cases, tests based on this procedure may be deceitful. This happens when the characteristic chosen to perform the sort is correlated with an external (unobservable) factor. They propose a novel regression-based approach aimed at bypassing this problem."

    "More recently and in a separate stream of literature, R. S. J. Koijen and Yogo (2019) have introduced a demand model in which investors form their portfolios according to their preferences towards particular firm characteristics. They show that this allows them to mimic the portfolios of large institutional investors. In their model, aggregate demands (and hence, prices) are directly linked to characteristics, not to factors. In a follow-up paper, R. S. Koijen, Richmond, and Yogo (2019) show that a few sets of characteristics suffice to predict future returns. They also show that, based on institutional holdings from the UK and the US, the largest investors are those who are the most influencial in the formation of prices. In a similar vein, Betermier, Calvet, and Jo (2019) derive an elegant (theoretical) general equilibrium model that generates some well-documented anomalies (size, book-to-market). The models of Arnott et al. (2014) and Alti and Titman (2019) are also able to theoretically generate known anomalies. Finally, in I. Martin and Nagel (2019), characteristics influence returns via the role they play in the predictability of dividend growth. This paper discussed the asymptotic case when the number of assets and the number of characteristics are proportional and both increase to infinity."

(2017), Hasler, Khapko, and Marfe (2019), Haddad, Kozak, and Santosh (2020) and Lioui and Tarelli (2020), negative for Asness et al. (2017) and mixed for Dichtl et al. (2019). There is no consensus on which predictors to use (general macroeconomic indicators in Hodges et al.

A method for building reasonable timing strategies for long-only portfolios with sustainable transaction costs is laid out in Leippold and Rüegg (2020).

    "The demand for ethical financial products has sharply risen during the 2010 decade, leading to the creation of funds dedicated to socially responsible investing (SRI - see Camilleri (2020)). Though this phenomenon is not really new (Schueth (2003), Hill et al. (2007)), its acceleration has prompted research about whether or not characteristics related to ESG criteria (environment, social, governance) are priced. Dozens and even possibly hundreds of papers have been devoted to this question, but no consensus has been reached. More and more, researchers study the financial impact of climate change (see Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis (2019), Hong, Li, and Xu (2019) and Hong, Karolyi, and Scheinkman (2020)) and the societal push for responsible corporate behavior (Fabozzi (2020), Kurtz (2020)). We gather below a very short list of papers that suggests conflicting results:\n",
    "- **favorable**: ESG investing works (Kempf and Osthoff (2007), Cheema-Fox et al. (2020)), can work (Nagy, Kassam, and Lee (2016), Alessandrini and Jondeau (2020)), or can at least be rendered efficient (Branch and Cai (2012)). A large meta-study reports overwhelming favorable results (Friede, Busch, and Bassen (2015)), but of course, they could well stem from the publication bias towards positive results.\n",
    "- **unfavorable**: Ethical investing is not profitable according to Adler and Kritzman (2008) and Blitz and Swinkels (2020). An ESG factor should be long unethical firms and short ethical ones (Lioui (2018)).\n",
    "- **mixed**: ESG investing may be beneficial globally but not locally (Chakrabarti and Sen (2020)). Portfolios relying on ESG screening do not significantly outperform those with no screening but are subject to lower levels of volatility (Gibson et al. (2020), Gougler and Utz (2020)). As is often the case, the devil is in the details, and results depend on whether to use E, S or G (Bruder et al. (2019))."

The first obvious difference is the introduction of the nonlinear function $g$: indeed, there is no reason (beyond simplicity and interpretability) why we should restrict the model to linear relationships.

    "More importantly, the second difference between (3.6) and (3.1) is the shift in the time index. Indeed, from an investor’s perspective, the interest is to be able to predict some information about the structure of the cross-section of assets. Explaining asset returns with synchronous factors is not useful because the realization of factor values is not known in advance. Hence, if one seeks to extract value from the model, there needs to be a time interval between the observation of the state space (which we call $\\textbf{x}_{t,n}$) and the occurrence of the returns. Once the model $\\hat{g}$ is estimated, the time-$t$ (measurable) value $g(\\textbf{x}_{t,n})$ will give a forecast for the (average) future returns. These predictions can then serve as signals in the crafting of portfolio weights (see Chapter 12 for more on that topic)."

Returns are straightforward and simple to compute, but they could very well be replaced by more sophisticated metrics, like the Sharpe ratio, for instance. The firms’ features would then be used to predict a risk-adjusted performance rather than simple returns."

In order to reduce and simplify the estimation problem, it is customary to define the SDF as a portfolio of assets (see chapter 3 in Back (2010)). In Luyang Chen, Pelger, and Zhu (2020), the authors use a generative adversarial network (GAN, see Section 7.7.1) to estimate the weights of the portfolios that are the closest to satisfy (3.7) under a strongly penalizing form."

Traditionally, the characteristics are present in the definition of factors (as in the seminal definition of Fama and French (1993)). The decomposition of the return is made according to the exposition of the firm’s return to these factors constructed according to market size, accounting ratios, past performance, etc. Given the exposures, the performance of the stock is attributed to particular style profiles (e.g., small stock, or value stock, etc.)."

For instance, firms below the 1/3 quantile in book-to-market are growth firms and those above the 2/3 quantile are the value firms. A value factor can then be defined by the long-short portfolio of these two sets, with uniform weights. Note that Fama and French (1993) use a more complex approach which also takes market capitalization into account both in the weighting scheme and also in the composition of the portfolios."

    "One of the advances enabled by machine learning is to automate the construction of the factors. It is for instance the approach of Feng, Polson, and Xu (2019). Instead of building the factors heuristically, the authors optimize the construction to maximize the fit in the cross-section of returns. The optimization is performed via a relatively deep feed-forward neural network and the feature space is lagged so that the relationship is indeed predictive, as in Equation (3.6). Theoretically, the resulting factors help explain a substantially larger proportion of the in-sample variance in the returns. The prediction ability of the model depends on how well it generalizes out-of-sample."

The literature is already exhaustive and it is often hard to disentangle the noise from the great ideas in the continuous flow of publications on these topics. Practice and implementation is the only way forward to extricate value from hype. This is especially true because agents often tend to overestimate the role of factors in the allocation decision process of real-world investors (see Alex Chinco, Hartzmark, and Sussman (2019) and Castaneda and Sabat (2019))."
